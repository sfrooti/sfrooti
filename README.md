- 👋 Hi friends, I’m @sfrooti and I run Studio Raada, an independent design studio focusing on Brand Strategy and Visual Identities for disruptors & changemakers.
- 
- 👀 I’m exploring how design thinking and storytelling in leadership can change the world.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub and maybe code something? I have many ideas :)
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any Open Source project where my skillset could be valuable!
